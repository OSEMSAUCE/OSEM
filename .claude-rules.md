# Project Rules for Claude

## CRITICAL: Data Handling Rules

### NEVER Calculate or Fabricate Data
- **ONLY use data that exists in the database**
- **NEVER calculate fallback values** (e.g., calculating area from geometry)
- **NEVER generate or infer data**
- If data is missing from the database, show it as null/"No data"
- Making up data wastes time and creates confusion

### Database-Only Policy
When working with data:
1. Pull attributes directly from database tables
2. If a field is null/empty in the database, leave it null/empty
3. Do not use libraries like Turf.js to calculate missing values
4. User prefers seeing "No data" over calculated approximations

### Example: Hectares Field
- ✅ CORRECT: `if (row.hectares) { area = row.hectares }`
- ❌ WRONG: `if (!row.hectares) { calculate area from geometry }`

## File Organization

### Cross-Project File Access
- Can read files from other directories using Read tool with full paths
- Database location: `/Users/chrisharris/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/DEV_PROJECTS/retreever/staging/staging.db`
- Schema files: `/Users/chrisharris/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/DEV_PROJECTS/retreever/staging/schema.sqlite.prisma`

## General Guidelines
- Always ask for clarification if data source is ambiguous
- Document data sources clearly in comments
- Prefer explicit null handling over implicit defaults
