## 8 Jan 2026 9:36AM

## Steps
We need to first move out of Subwoof and check all the import paths in other files, then check and confirm with Chris that the app still works for each of the following directory. Do them one at a time and check off the box when you're done. check with Chris between each move. In a lot of cases you have to merge them with the directory of the same name in lib.
1. [ ] components - move and merge
2. [ ] config - move
3. [ ] routes - move and merge
4. [ ] static - move 
5. [X] styles - move 
6. [ ] types - move
