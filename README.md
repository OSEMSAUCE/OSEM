## Open Source Environmental Movement

OSEM is A collaboration of awesome people who want environmental work to be powerful and transparent (not BS). Our main task at hand is making a HUUUUGE f'ing repo of reforestation data because we rocked at tree planting for so long and now we want to give back. Also, it's an awesome idea! If we publish even 5% of reforestation data (who planted what trees where and when), then it would tilt the whole industry towards transparency, which would have a MASSIVE effect on the quality and productivity of reforestation. For real. Right now, if you want ESG funding for reforestation, basically anyone can put up a website with experts and logos and claim to plant trees. But we can fix that by making the world's first sizable open-source reforestation dataset. You can go bananas🍌️🍌️ making visualizations 📊️ and investigations, and the industry will improve immensely with the expectation—requirement even—that reforestation be open source.

**Please join us; there is TONS of work to be done.**

## 🌳 We Need Your Help: Contribute Tree Planting Data

We’re building the first centralized open dataset to track the **who, what, where, and when** of global tree planting efforts. This dataset is the backbone of our mission, and **we can’t do it without your help.**  

### 🎯 The Data We’re Looking For:
- **Who** planted the trees (e.g., organization, company, or group).
- **What** trees were planted (species information is a huge bonus!).
- **Where** the trees were planted (specific GPS coordinates or location names).
- **When** the planting happened (specific dates or timeframes).  

📋 **Example Dataset**  
Here’s a [sample dataset](#) to show you the structure we’re looking for (Google Sheets).

### 🌐 How You Can Help

#### 1. **Find Tree Planting Data**
Governments, NGOs, and organizations often publish tree-planting stats. Some places to start:
- [Canada Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca)
- Look for government or environmental data portals in any country and search "reforestation"

#### 2. **Share or Clean Data**
- If you have raw tree planting data, upload it to the repository!
- Help us **clean and preprocess** data so it’s ready for analysis.

#### 3. **Build Tools**
Love to code? We need developers to:
- Automate data pipelines (ETL: Extract, Transform, Load).
- Build tools to analyze or visualize the dataset.
- Create applications for distributing and managing this data.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

While reforestation is critical in fighting climate change, it also raises a lot of valid questions about validity claims, vague reporting, and other BS. This harms funders, ecosystems, and those of us who work our asses off to plant trees and do other legitimate environmental good. 

This project:
- Tracks global reforestation production and shares it as clean, transparent data sets available for everyone, no strings attached. 
- Promotes transparency and accountability.
- Elevates the quality of reforestation work worldwide
- is run and managed by actual reforestation: workers, contractors, and software developers.
